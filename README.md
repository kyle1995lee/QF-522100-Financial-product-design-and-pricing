# QF-522100-Financial-product-design-and-pricing
Course taken in NTHU using Excel VBA, data used is mostly in excel files, so I've uploaded the .xlsm files along with the .bas files.

Short descriptions:(Note: Some buttons may not work if activeX is not available)  
hw1: Using the macro function along with creating buttons and message boxes, also to get familiar with the VBA editor in excel.  
hw2: Knowing the differece between functions and sub and created both to calculate black scholes for given data.  
hw3: Created userform interface and buttons to switch between worksheets, also calculate vanilla call, put and cashornothing call, put using black scholes formula.   
hw4: Created function to calculated chooser options, and graphed bull/bear spread options.  
hw5: Created and visualized a whole simplified binomial tree using either functions and sub.  
hw6: Created and visualized JR, CRR trees using either functions and sub. Also compared how the values of abovementioned trees converge towards the black-scholes value as the steps in trees gets larger.   
hw7: Created and visualized trinomial tree, and calculated and compared the tree values to black scholes.  
hw8: Used Monte Carlo method to simlulate share price, also used exponential normal to perform monte carlo integration.  
hw9: Performed normsinv and box muller on halton sequence and original rand() sequence to create random distributions, also visualized for more comparisons.  
hw10: Familiarized with random functions and how they work.  
hw11: Calculated SIGN options by using binomial trees and monte carlo simulation.  
hw12: Calculated barrier options and target redemption forward using functions and black scholes.  
hw13: Simulated share price using monte carlo and calculated asian and lookback options using black scholes.  
hw14: Calculated foreign exchange options and an example from Sallie Mae. 
hw Final project: Created an option based on the floating NBA ticket prices of the Oklahoma City Thunders. Our main design is based on the binomial model. Main influence factors we've decided to include are current total wins in this season, whether the ticket is on weekdays or weekends, if the players are injured badly or not(we used a normal distribution random generator to simulate the chances of getting injured), and tweeks on the increase/decrease rates of the binomial model.
